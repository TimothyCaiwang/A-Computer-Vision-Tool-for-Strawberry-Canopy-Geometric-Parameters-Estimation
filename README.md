R scripts for strawberry canopy delineation and Python scripts for canopy size metrics calculations

Individual strawberry plant detection is a critical step in the calculation of canopy structural parameters. An image processing workflow (Figure 2) was established to perform canopy delineation from the UAV multispectral imagery. The input dataset for this workflow consists of four datasets: 1) Orthomosaic image and DSM generated from raw UAV images using the SfM algorithm; 2) A shp layer named as “Study Boundary” which defines the study area and clip the datasets to a tighter field boundary, which results in a smaller analysis scope and therefore shorter processing times; 3) An optional shp layer “Top Bed Boundary” outlining the boundary of strawberry breeding beds. This layer can help remove most weed effects; 4) A shp layer containing a single point that is approximately located at the center of each plant. For the canopy delineation of strawberry plants in UAV images, the largest difficulty lies in the adhesion of multiple canopies. This is why the Marker Controlled Watershed Algorithm (MCWA) was adopted in this study. However, early strawberry plants are separated from each other in the image. Traditional computer vision methods can process images collected in early growth stages to generate an initial centroid point shp file, and the relevant R and Python scripts can be found here: xxx.
