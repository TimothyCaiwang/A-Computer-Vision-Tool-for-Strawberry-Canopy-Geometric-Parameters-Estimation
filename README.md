# A-Computer-Vision-Tool-for-Strawberry-Canopy-Geometric-Parameters-Estimation
R scripts for strawberry canopy delineation and Python scripts for canopy size metrics calculations.

Individual strawberry plant detection is a critical step in the calculation of canopy structural parameters. An image processing workflow was established to perform canopy delineation from the UAV multispectral imagery. The input dataset for this workflow consists of four datasets: 
1) Orthomosaic image and DSM generated from raw UAV images using the SfM algorithm;  
2) A shp layer containing a single point that is approximately located at the center of each plant, which can be generated using the UAV images in the early stage.
